# Trie Tests

These are basic tests for testing the only the Trie. 

Note: valgrind is not enabled automatically

## Running (recommended)

I recommend using CLion to run these tests, which simplifies running them with valgrind.

## Running (from terminal, no valgrind)

Copy this into your `hw8` directory and run the following

```
cmake .
cd cmake-build-debug
make
./Trie-Test
```
